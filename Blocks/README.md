On adding the word "block" to Legal Components:  The word block brings together the concepts of content/ user actions encapsulation into a card like rectangle structuring data layout/display and content/entity transactions encapsulation into a ledger like event entry structure for data model/format.  The Legal Components, Modular Trust Framework and Dynamic Deal Terms projects all used the phrase "contract card" or "clause card" or other "card" based phrase.  The word "block" conveys more of the intended format, function and flow than the word "card".
