SystemRules
===========

This GitHub repo represents an experimental approach to iteration and document version management for system rules, agreements and associated documents or records including legal, policy and business procedures.  The model rules document was tailored for use with personal data stores however the general approach of multi-party systems rules for "walled gardens" or "circles of trust" is generically applicable to many contexts, scenarios and use cases.  Additional examples of the application of this model are being collected and new examples are being developed at this time.  

For more information on this project, please see the project page at: http://ecitizen.mit.edu/modelrules

The authoritative document as of June 20, 2013 is published in PDF form at http://openpds.media.mit.edu/#rules  however it is anticipated that the authoritative version will soon be located at a GitHub repository.
