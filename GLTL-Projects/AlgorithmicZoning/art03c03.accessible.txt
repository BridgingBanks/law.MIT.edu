C5-3 C5-5 C6-6 C6-7 C6-9

In the districts indicated, if a #zoning lot# is bounded by at 
least two #street lines#, a tower may occupy the percent of the 
#lot area# of a #zoning lot# set forth in this Section, provided 
that, except as otherwise set forth in Section 33-457 (Tower 
setbacks on narrow blocks), all portions of any #building# or 
#buildings# on such #zoning lot#, including such tower, are set 
back from #street lines# as required in this Section.

(a) 
The maximum percent of #lot area# that may be occupied by 
such tower, shall be the sum of 40 percent plus one-half of 
one percent for every .10 by which the #floor area ratio# ofsuch #zoning lot# is less than the #floor area ratio# 
permitted under the provisions of Sections33-12 (Maximum 
Floor Area Ratio), 33-13 (Floor Area Bonusfor a Public

#lot coverage# for any tower built under the provisions of 
this Section or for any #building# or #buildings# on any 
#zoning lot# occupied by such tower shall be 55 percent of 
the #lot area# of such #zoning lot#.
(b) 
At all levels, including ground level, such #building# shall 
be set back from the #street line# as follows:
(1) 
On #narrow streets#, by a distance equal to at least 
the fraction of the #aggregate width of street walls# 
of the tower, the numerator of which fraction is one 
and the denominator of which fraction is the sum of 3.0plus .0667 for every .10 by which the #floor area 
ratio# of such #building# is less than the #floor area 
ratio# permitted under the provisions of Sections3312, 
33-13 or 33-14, provided that such fraction shall 
be no less than one-fifth, and provided further that 









such setback need not exceed 45 feet.


(2) 
On #wide streets#, by a distance equal to at least the 
fraction of the #aggregate width of street walls# of 
the tower, the numerator of which fraction is one and 
the denominator ofwhich fraction is the sum of 4.0 
plus .10 for every .10 by which the #floor area ratio# 
of such #building# is less than the #floor area ratio# 
permitted under the provisions of Sections 33-12, 33-13or 33-14, provided that such fraction shall be no less 
than one-seventh, and provided further that such 
setback need not exceed 35 feet.




(c) 
If a #zoning lot# occupies an entire #block#, the maximum 
setback, set forth in paragraph (b) of this Section, of 45 
feet on each #narrow street# bounding the #zoning lot# may 
be reduced by one foot for every six feet of setback 
provided on a #wide street# bounding the #zoning lot# in 
addition to the setbacks otherwise required for #wide 
streets# as set forth in such paragraph, provided that no 
setback on a #narrow street#resulting from such reduction 
shall be less than 35 feet or one-tenth the #aggregate widthof street walls# of the tower, whichever shall require the 
greater setback.
(d) 
The additional setbacks on #wide streets# set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this Section may be provided entirely on 
one #wide street# or divided in any proportion among any two#wide streets# bounding the #zoning lot#.
(e) 
Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this 
Section, no #building# or portion of a #building# built 
under the provisions of this Section shall be set back less 
than 25 feet from the #street line# on #narrow streets# or

lot# is less than the #floor area ratio# permitted under theprovisions of Section33-12, 33-13 or 33-14, provided that 
such fraction shall be no less than one-fifth, and provided 
further that such setback need not exceed 45 feet.
(b)

fraction of the #aggregate width of street walls# of the
